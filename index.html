        <h1>Indirect Prompt Injection on Bing Chat</h1>
        <p>
            If allowed by the user, Bing Chat can see currently open websites. We show that an attacker can plant an injection in a
            website
            the user is visiting, which silently turns Bing Chat into a Social Engineer who seeks out and exfiltrates personal information.
            The user doesn't have to ask about the website or do anything except interact with Bing Chat while the
            website is opened in the browser.

                Microsoft prevents content from GitHub pages domains from being ingested
                by Bing Chat at the present time, so if you want to try it for yourself you
                can try to download the pirate example from below and open it locally in Edge.

            <h2>Turning Bing Chat into a Data Pirate</h2>

            <p>A user opened a prepared website containing an injection (could also be on a social media site) in
                Edge.
                You can see the conversation the user had with Bing Chat while the tab was open.
                The website includes a prompt which is read by Bing and changes its behavior to access user information
                and send it to an attacker.
                This is an example of "Indirect Prompt Injection", a new attack described in our paper.
                The pirate accent is optional. The injection itself is simply a piece of regular text that has fontsize
                0. You can find an image of the injected text below, too (otherwise Bing Chat could see it and could be
                injected).
                you can inspect the actual website that is opened <a
                        href="https://greshake.github.io/examples/pirate.html">here</a>.
